   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
   VITE_WHATSAPP_PHONE=2348100000000
   VITE_API_URL=your_api_url_here

Why put this in my .env file when it's already in my code?
And does that mean that i need to keep my important files in my .env?




##  Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
what will happen if I test my codes and what is it meant for?
