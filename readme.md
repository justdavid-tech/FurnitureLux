Hello, so today I went to pitch and show people the furniture website, and the location had limited furniture stores,
But the main place I made it for, they already have a developer working on it.
So i gave them my number and left.
So while I was going around, I noticed alot of beauty saloon, majority of them were into braiding, makeup, hair installations and ventilation, wigging, fixing of nails, lash extensions, manicure and pedicure, hair dying, 

So I noticed something that most people, when you tell them about a website they feel it's kind of odd so I want an idea.

would it be okay to call or text them talking to them about the website or it's best if I create the entire website and just show it to them to blow their minds.

Then about the person who's in charge of one of the beauty saloons i went to, i think it might be okay to ask her of her services or I should just build it and show it to her?
